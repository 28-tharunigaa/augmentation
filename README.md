# Text and Image Augmentation using Generative AI

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based implementation for augmenting text and images using Generative AI techniques. The code leverages deep learning models to generate synthetic variations of textual and visual data, enhancing datasets for training robust machine learning models.

## Features
- **Text Augmentation:**
  - Synonym replacement
  - Back translation
  - Text paraphrasing using AI models (e.g., GPT-based models)
  - Random word insertion and deletion
  
- **Image Augmentation:**
  - Rotation, flipping, and scaling
  - Color jittering and brightness adjustment
  - Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based synthetic image generation
  - Style transfer and domain adaptation

## Usage
### Text Augmentation
Run the text augmentation script to generate variations of input text:
```bash
python text_augment.py --input "This is an example sentence."
```

### Image Augmentation
Run the image augmentation script to generate augmented images:
```bash
python image_augment.py --input path/to/image.jpg
```

## Examples
- **Original Text:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- **Augmented Text:** "A fast dark fox leaps over a sluggish canine."

- **Original Image:** (Displays an input image)
- **Augmented Image:** (Shows variations such as flipped, rotated, or GAN-generated images)
